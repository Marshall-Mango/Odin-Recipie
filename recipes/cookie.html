    <h4> Delicious Choclate chip cookies</h4>
    <p>To make chocolate chip cookies, start by creaming together softened butter with brown and white sugars until fluffy. Beat in eggs and vanilla extract, then stir in flour, baking soda, and salt to form a dough. Fold in plenty of chocolate chips, scoop the dough onto a baking sheet, and bake until the edges are golden and the centers are soft. Let them cool slightly before devouring—warm, gooey perfection in every bite.</p>
